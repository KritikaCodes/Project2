Your response goes here!

#1 I have learned various new tags that I hadn’t looked into before starting the program. Learned more about relative vs absolute, local vs external paths. Learned more about git! :D
#2 creating elements has been easy so far.
#3 Getting stuck and then being unable to figure out what’s wrong, even though it was very apparent!
#4 I did!! I tried figuring out how to resolve an issue I was having. I tried various ways to approach it. I googled more examples and learned a lot more about relative paths. And when I still couldn’t fix the issue, I reached out to my fellow students. :)
